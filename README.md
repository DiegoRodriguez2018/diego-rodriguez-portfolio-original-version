## Design Process
From the beginning of the design process several digital tools were used including:

* [ Trello Boards ](docs/Trello.md):
    
    Trello Boards were very useful to plan the whole portfolio planning and deployment. Please click/tap to the link above to view screenshots of the Trello board as it evolved through the project. 


* [Figma](docs/Figma.md)
    
    Figma was used to develop the Wireframe of the website and also to explore and design a few logos for the portfolio. Please click/tap the link above to see screenshots of the process. 


* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/)
    
    Inkscape is an open source professional vector graphics editor. Inkscape was used in this project to perform adjustments to svg files as required. Please click/tap the link above to redirect to the official Inkscape website.


The designing process started by developing a [moodboard](docs/Moodboard.md), which you can check by following this [link](docs/Moodboard.md). This moodboard was somehow broad but it helped me to gain a good insight of how the final product was going to look like. 

After developing the moodboard, I proceed to work on the [wireframes](docs/Figma.md) of the website on Figma, where a few designs and color patterns were analysed. To have a look to this wireframes plese follow this [link](docs/Figma.md)
