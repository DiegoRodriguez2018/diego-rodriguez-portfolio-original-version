        Hi, Iâ€™m Diego. I have professional experience in diverse sectors, including the industrial,
        environmental and academic sectors. I enjoy interacting and creating technology and in the last years I
        have develop a true passion for software development.
      </p>

        I love finding creative ways to solve complex problems. I appreciate when technology is done right as I
        have seen how it can empower people to archive more and even improve their quality of life.
